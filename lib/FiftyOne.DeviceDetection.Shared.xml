            Data class that contains meta-data relating to a specific 
            component.
            A component is a logical group of properties for example, all
            properties relating to the hardware device or all properties
            relating to the web browser.
            This variation is used for meta-data that is generated by the
            c# code rather than the native C/C++ code.
            For example, this is used to add placeholder component meta-data 
            for the 'metrics' properties because they don't have any associated
            meta-data in the data file.

            Data class that contains meta-data relating to a specific

            For example, this is used to add placeholder property meta-data
